Project Destription
This project is a study of the  mouse usage patterns and training deep learning models for behavioral biometrics, particularily aims to make a significant contribution to the field of cybersecurity by developing and training advanced deep learning models capable of distinguishing between human and automated (bot) user behaviour based on mouse dynamics.

## 2. Datasets overview
### PMC
PMC is Dynamics Dataset (published via the National Library of Medicine, a U.S. government official source). This dataset contains 2,550 hours of active usage data from 24 users. (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/w6cxr8yc7p/2) 

This dataset is a collection of 24 users into for 2,550 hours:
- `train` - 
- `validation` - 
- `test` -
It provides .... and ....  and "........" methods.

A subset of 24 users from the 'train' set was used in this implementation for training purposes. This was done for two reasons. This subset was uploaded to ...... and is remotely downloaded when the solution is ran.
1. To avoid ........ download limits we ran into while preparing the dataset
2. Reduce the computational resources required for training the models over high epoch counts. This arose from another issue we ran into where Google Colab restricted our GPU useage during one of our earlier tests.

## 3. Results



## Instructions to run the solution
The `jupyter` notebook will be uploaded. Download the file titled 'SRGAN Implementation'. Pressing 'Run' on each of the cells in order (top-to-bottom) will produce the expected results.
